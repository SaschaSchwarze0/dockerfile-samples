# Dockerfile samples

This repository contains a set of Dockerfile samples. Each directory contains a bad and at least one good Dockerfile. The focus is on creating container images with a smaller size. An executable `build.sh` bash script is also included in each directory to run `docker build` for each container image and a comparisson of the resulting container images in their size.
